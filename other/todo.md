The goal is small, readable versions of everything but the discussion; write something small and readable, then expand and iterate as far as you can.

------

- [x] Results: look at those outlines with fresher eyes and make sure every claim has solid argumentative backing; if not, scratch it.
- [x] Results: type the surviving claims in full sentences with expanded abbreviations into outlines of the results section.
- [x] Methods: look at the methods questions, and write a 1-paragraph (longer only if needed) answer to each -- you now have that first little version of the methods section. 
- [ ] Lit review, postmodern: Turn each of the four tools into an action phrase; find examples of each usage in the results, and write a 1-paragraph description of each tool, with a "for-instance" example sentence. Make sure you have an "intro to postmodernism" section and a "where this shows up in engineering education" section, and that's it -- you now have that first little version.
- [ ] Lit review, narrative: Take a break and look at Todd and Lindsey's feedback offline first; you are probably extremely close to a small version if you cut a lot -- do it!
- [ ] Lit review, faculty as learners: Looking at Todd and Sebastian's documents, write an outline down on paper -- use post-its if you need to. Now write a paragraph for each item in the outline. You now have that first little version.
- [] Results: expand the outlines into things that look like blog posts; you now have a first little version.

------

- [ ] Results: find and copy-paste the data snippets I have specified as evidence for each claim (right now they're written as things like "Mark's quote about how students can't give well-informed curricular feedback" -- it's specific, it's there somewhere, I need to text-search to find it and snip it in)
- [ ] Results: type the warrants for each data snippet -- again, they're in longhand outline form, but need to be expanded and I suspect might shift and expand even more once I'm staring at the appropriate data snippet.
- [ ] Methods: one paragraph on each of the validity criteria from Glassick and Lather, and one paragraph on how I've fulfilled each of those criteria.
- [ ] Methods: go through the (printed-out) version of the methods section; if any paragraph fits into an existing tiny draft paragraph, then go ahead and put it in the right place. You know you'll need to edit the "how I analyzed stuff" section into past-tense and rip out the analysis parts you didn't actually do.
- [x] Methods: each narrator's self-intro from their first interview copy-pasted into the appropriate location.
- [ ] Methods/Litrev: Look at handwritten notes from readings and put them in the right dissertation chapter.

## Intro

Looking at faculty as learners in this particular way is a helpful contribution to the field.

## Lit review (3 parts)

1. Postmodern tools can help us understand faculty as learners in liminal spaces like curricular (re)design. This is what postmodernism is, and here are the tools.

2. Narratives can help us understand faculty as learners in a postmodern way. This is what narratives are (for the purposes of this study), and here's what it means to take a postmodern approach to narrative.

3. Let's compare and contrast postmodern and non-postmodern approaches (including learning theories) to understanding faculty as learners, and place each approach in the context of the history of faculty development and the evolution of the faculty role. (NOTE: It took a while to figure out that this was what I was doing in this section; there are some gaps, but I'm getting a clearer -- though still not completely clear -- idea of where the gaps are.)

## Methods

Here's what I did.

## Results

(yes, there's data for all of these, that's what I'm trying to make-readable right now):

###"You told me Darth Vader killed my father!"
1. There's a consistent metanarrative of "faculty design the curriculum for the students." In other words, this framing creates an ontology with 3 distinct categories of self (faculty) world (curriculum, defined as the totality of the created learning environment) and other (students) -- and specifies roles for them: curriculum is by the faculty and for the students. This isn't untrue, but it also isn't everything. Let's investigate, using those postmodern tools we've already explained in the lit and methods sections.

###"Avengers, assembl(age)!"
2. (Troubling the notion of the "self") When we look at the (faculty) self, we see that faculty learners are assemblages (shifting configurations of active agents and inanimate objects) rather than distinct individuals (that do change, but do so within static boundaries that keep them as stable units of analysis to track that change in over time). They collaborate and learn in shifting groups that are simultaneously unified and composed of distinct pieces (like the Avengers, a superhero team whose membership keeps changing) -- the phrase "faculty as learners" simultaneously refers to faculty in the singular and the plural. Going in the other direction, even an "individual faculty member" narrates themselves as many characters at once ("myself in grad school" vs "myself in the classroom now" vs "myself at home with my kids") and the boundaries between these characters are not distinct.

###"I am the Doctor."
3. (Troubling the boundary between "self" and "world") Curricular designs are not only by the faculty; they are for, by, *and* of the faculty. Course designs are initiated starting from faculty interests, needs, and desires ("we should do something together", "we all need to learn to teach this course," etc.) Course designs incorporate the philosophies and values of the faculty who teach them (the 2nd and 7th Doctors are both Dr. Who, but they are also different Doctors -- instructors are no more interchangeable than actors) -- there's a sense in which the faculty *are* the curriculum.

###"Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra!"
4. (Troubling our notions of the "world") We represent our ontological conceptions of the world (curriculum) in language. Language collisions happen because different selves in dialogue have different perspectives. Language collisions are evidence of, and opportunity for, faculty as learners. Sometimes faculty try to get out of that "collision" space by seeing it as a mistake -- we should avoid these collisons, resolve them ASAP, in hindsight we should have known we were doing X all along, etc.

###"Live. Die. Repeat." (or: Groundhog Day)
5. (Still troubling our notions of the "world") We also represent our ontological conceptions of the world (curriculum) in action, which is inextricably woven with language. Curricular design and teaching iterations are evidence of and sites for faculty learning; hiding the iterations (as faculty sometimes try to do) hides the learning. (NOTE: This may or may not merge with #4; they're kind of the same concept, but got too big to write as one section at this time.)

###Missing scifi reference! (Mr. Holland's Opus?)
6. (Troubling the boundary between "world" and "other") Faculty learn as downstream recipients of curricula; they inherit courses (or a gap in which a course needs to be created) as well as students who've been influenced by the courses they've already taken. The "curriculum" for faculty learning is, among other things, by/for/of both colleagues and students (as well as other more distant entities like student employers). This "curriculum" space is not a separate world from the one the same faculty are creating "for the students." Students can do things that substantially affect the direction of a course. 

###"Where is the horse and the rider?" ("Farmers, farriers, stable boys. These are no soldiers.")
7. (Troubling the boundary between "self" and "other") By the transitive property, if faculty and students both blur into the curriculum, they also blur into each other. There is a difficult tension regarding the distinction between faculty as learners and students as learners, and how these people-as-learners author the curriculum. This tension shows up in discussions on the role of students in curricular design. 

## Discussion

When we allow ourselves to shift, blur, add, and remove our arbitrary categories and boundaries around these assemblages, we open up different possibilities for teaching and learning for everyone. (NOTE: This hasn't quite taken shape yet, but a few things that may be in it:)

* A deconstruction of one case ("Rob's feedback sessions") from the data that does take this approach (but doesn't name it).
* Conway's Law (the parallel between curricular structure and faculty relationships)
* The "surgeon" analogy as a way to illustrate how sticking to the "for the students" metanarrative de-privileges faculty needs, especially underrepresented faculty
* The "study abroad" analogy as a way to discuss how we recognize some of this complexity for student learning, but not formally for faculty
* Examples of where this (postmodern) framing already shows up in faculty lives
* Examples of how ignoring this framing may be related to several stereotypical faculty complaints
