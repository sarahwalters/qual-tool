Curricular design and teaching iterations are evidence of and sites for faculty learning; hiding the iterations hides the learning.

This interrogates the fluidity of the world in contrast with the way faculty present it.

Iterations are learning.
--------------------------

DATA: Instances of "first time" teaching described as making a mess (Alan re: 130)

DATA: Instances of teaching courses more than once and "getting better" at it (Mark: first time through for Daniel)

DATA: Lynn -- eventually we figured out what we were doing with UOCD.

DATA: Jon and Rob -- iterations on Stuff of History

DATA: Lynn -- when we designed E4H, we designed it "correctly" from the start.

Faculty revealing their own learning to the students can be a learning moment for students, too.
ALAN 2: There's just no way you can avoid it, and if you try to hide it it'll be worse. So we just say "Yeah, we're trying to team teach with four people and it's hard." (257)
MEL-A2: That's gotta be a huge learning moment for the students also. (258)
ALAN 2: Oh yeah, it is. (259)

Reflecting on our experiences, that critical scholarly step according to Glassick et al... it's iteration.
107:MARK 2: But I think in some ways -- now, this is not everything, but in some ways, we're getting past that a little bit, and now it's like -- oh, I see you've done this in class. What was the benefit to the students from doing that, or even better, saying -- what was your intention? For this. Oh, I see that. Let's talk about what else we can do. (107)

Iterations can be seen as noise, and for good reason.
------------------------------------------------------------------

DATA: Gary - "it's messy/distracting"

DATA: Lynn -- "thank goodness we know what we're doing now"

This shift is hard for many reasons

Why do we have a hard time getting away from "for the students?" (sometimes students aren't ready for things, too)

It is uncomfortable to say things are for the students. Sometimes students don't expect to see faculty learning. Sometimes, faculty needs prevent student needs from being met.

176:ROB 4: If one of us doesn't buy into the syllabus, we're not really holding a course 'cause the students will pick up on this and that's not fair to the students, and it's misleading, to say, "Oh, don't listen to that part of the syllabus, I didn't buy into it." That's just ridiculous. So you need some sort of agreement on a syllabus as a whole before the semester starts. (176)

Hide faculty learning from students! It will hurt them!
57:GARY 3: So, I think, that was sort of the toughest piece, because a couple of the colleagues really didn't understand where this was going or why, for a lot of the term. So that was stuff that we had to hash out among ourselves, or try to hash out among ourselves. And I hope that that didn't show up to the students, and by the time that we were doing thing in the classes that it looked like it was a little more organized and uniform and there for a purpose. (57)

MEL-G2: And how is that process going with the students?  Is it okay once the students get to it?  Or are the students learning... (46)
GARY 2: I think it's been pretty messy so far.  You know, I think people are making assignments that student aren't clear on, and that... just some of the technology used to submit stuff and to grade stuff, faculty have had difficulty getting to it.  Students, I'm not sure [if they] understood it.  But I think we're getting to a point where we're working through that. (47)
MEL-G2: So the students are seeing your course design process a little bit with the messiness. (48)
GARY 2: Probably, yes. (49)
MEL-G2: And the messiness, is that, is that a negative thing?  A positive thing?  A neutral thing?  A learning opportunity?  Or just getting in the way of doing stuff? (52)
GARY 2: I think it's been in the way pretty much.  That's my personal opinion.  Mm-hmm. (53)


When we package for others, we exclude the noise.
----------------------------------------------------

DATA: Gary - hopes of passing on 130 to a new faculty member

DATA: Jon and Rob - reverse-engineering the process for faculty workshops

DATA: Jon on packaging

LYNN 6: Interesting.  Jon's packaging fits there as well, as a different point. (295)
MEL-L6: ...it does! (296)
MEL-L6: yeah, it does. (297)
JON 2: It is basically about developing our understanding about what we are doing so we can package and communicate to the outside world. So that loop of interfacing with outside people, helping them develop ideas, spending time on packaging and communicating, translating our stuff... (93)

44:ALAN 1: Now, it's probably not because of flipping the classroom. It's just they have a lot to learn. You can't just say, okay, you get this a group and you're going to do this. You have to explain why and that takes a while to learn how to do those types of things. It's kind of uncomfortable, I think, for someone that is used to lecturing and demonstrating and using power point in front of a classroom to now, okay, turn a lot of the learning over to the students. (44)

46:ALAN 1: You can't just throw it out there to the students. There has to be more explanation. The students have to understand. The students may not be ready for that in a traditional lecture type course. Like if you were taking a history course, you're probably used to listening to a professor talk and lead the class. Now if that person turns around and says okay you're going to break up in groups and talk about the topic and present to the entire class, that's a different way of learning and it may take students a while to catch on to that where I think if a student that comes into technology, to take a technology class, I think they would, they're used to working a lab. They assume there's lab work to it so it's not a big change. They're not shocked by oh, yeah we're going to work if lab instead of listening to someone talk about doing things. (46)

103:ALAN 2: Yeah. Ah no. I mean they're still, everybody's talking and getting excited about the flipped classroom, where the students take more responsibility. (103)

105:ALAN 2: Yeah they're still working through it, they've had successes and failures. Some professors, their courses evaluations went down, a few students did not respond well to work outside of class, coming in totally prepared, and a lot of faculty didn't understand how to teach in that kind of situation where you turned a lot of the responsibility over to the students. Some of the comments on, lets say on IEQs might be like, "The teacher is unprepared." "They're... They don't have a definite plan." And that's because they're not used to it, and the teacher wasn't used to it. (105)

And yet this noise can also be seen as signal.
-------------------------------------------------

It's possible we may want to learn from it in the future, since we're never "done" learning from a story.

Narratives are the nice stories we tell in hindsight. If we knew the story before we lived it, we wouldn't have gone on the journey; we would already have arrived at the destination.
