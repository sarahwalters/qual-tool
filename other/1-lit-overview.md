Prior work: tools to think with
==================================

Overview
------------

This section presents a more in-depth view of three areas where we can employ prior literature as "tools to think with" for the topic of faculty as learners. The three areas are (1) learning situated in the community and culture of academic practice, (2) poststructuralism/postmodernism as a set of tools for examining learning in liminal spaces, and (3) narrative as a way of making sense of the world.

We will first examine the literature on situated and communal learning. Faculty do not learn in isolation, nor do they learn in a vacuum. Instead, they learn alongside others in the context of their shared lives as academics. As part of understanding how faculty learning is situated in academic community, we will also investigate what that academic community looks like and how it has historically operated, especially within engineering and technology.

We will then discuss curricular (re)design and innovation as liminal spaces within the faculty experience of academia. Poststructuralism and postmodernism (post-) paradigms offer us tools for understanding learning in liminal spaces. We will go through several of these post- tools and discuss how each of them helps us understand and disrupt our views of faculty as learners.

Finally, we will turn to the literature on narrative. Narration is a way of engaging in learning; narrations also serve as proof that one has learned. We will look at the role of narration in the context of a community of practice, and discuss what it might mean to take a poststructural/postmodern perspective on it.
