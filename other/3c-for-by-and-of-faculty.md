Curricular design is for, by, and of the faculty.

This blurs the distinction between the faculty-self and the curriculum-world.

Surgeon story
----------------
A story may be useful to illustrate this point. Imagine a group of surgeons designing medical equipment They will be using this equipment to perform a certain surgery on a large population of patients. The patients are certainly stakeholders in the equipment design, and their values and needs must be taken into account. For example, the scalpel needs to be sharp and long enough to cut through the right tissues in the human population undergoing surgery; it can't be designed for a mouse or an elephant. Additionally, the operating table needs to be long enough for tall patients to lie down, and sturdy enough to hold heavy patients. Surgical drapes should be designed to account for the patients' cultural values of modesty, and so forth.

However, it would be strange to require all design decisions to be justified solely in terms of patient benefit. Imagine what would happen if the surgeons said “We need the scalpel to be controllable by both left and right-handed people...  because some of the patients are left-handed.” The surgeons are controlling the scalpel, not the patients. The scalpel may indeed need to work for both left-handed and right-handed surgeons, but that's because there are left-handed surgeons – not because there are left-handed patients.

Both surgeon and patient needs and values need to be taken into account when designing the medical equipment. The operating table needs to adjust to the height and girth of the patient, but it also needs to adjust to the height and reach of the doctor. Surgical drapes need to account for patient privacy while giving surgeons access to the body parts they will be working on. It may be useful to see surgeons as a different type of user group than patients, but they are both users. Furthermore, some people may belong to both user groups; some surgeons may also undergo the surgery.

Similarly, while students are users of curriculum, they are not the only users. Faculty  also experience their own curricular designs/environments, and have needs and values that inevitably end up shaping the curricular design, whether we admit it or not.

By the faculty
------------------
The idea of curriculum being "by the faculty" is already part of the metanarrative.

For the faculty
------------------

Gary: “I’m here because I keep on learning” (#?)

DATA: 130 as a facdev opportunity

DATA: Stuff of History as "let's do this together"

89:LYNN 5: He is absolutely right about the value of biting his tongue/waiting, and he is absolutely brilliant at this.  I've taught with him and watched him.  I think he's tried to coach me, too, but I'm not good at it.  If I'm thinking, I'm talking.  This is something I'm really trying to learn -- to be quiet, to listen, to wait -- but it is not something natural for me AT ALL/ (189)

JON 3: I think I might have been a little too... wrapped up in my own process of learning... Honestly I don't know if I was able to sort through what was going on for students at the time. (92)
121:JON 1: We were there, present, chatting with students on occasion but in terms of facilitating student learning and development and supporting it, I think we were doing a horrible job. (121)

169:JON 6: Here we were in this open studio with a bunch of pin up, bulletin boards and sticky notes, and really not much else, asked to do these mysterious... Asked to facilitate student learning in this domain that was new to us, doing activities that were foreign to us, and I think it was just a little bit of cognitive overload paralyzed us. (169)

Discussing watching how students learn, but using it as a way to help faculty develop, so they can help students learn later
GARY 3: On several occasions, Mark would actually come in and sit in on our class and can make observations on what worked and what didn't work. And then I would do follow-up with Mark after that, 'cause he would make modifications on what we had done, and then he could make comments on what he saw worked after you change things or what didn't work. (72)
MEL-G3: Yeah, Mark did mention that, that he was going back and forth and trying to observe the sections. And it sounds like that was a really good growth experience for him. (73)
GARY 3: Yeah, I think it was. And I found it really meaningful to have those conversations with Mark, because we were also team teaching an upper level class. (74)

Mark's anecdote brings up another point: far from only being designers of curricula, faculty also learners themselves. Mark's story about the “thick skin” portrays him as a faculty learner in a context outside of curricular design, namely in the summer leadership institute he had attended. However, faculty are also learners in the context of the curriculum they are designing. Gary illustrates this point:

GARY 3: So, team teaching, that was a big piece to figure out what people understood and what their hot buttons were, and what they felt was the most important pieces, and how to negotiate that to then come up with the best content for the students. (92)

The end goal is to create “the best content for the students.” However, in order to do this, the faculty need to learn several things for themselves. Faculty need to “figure out” things about each other, learn things about their colleagues' triggers and values, and learn negotiation skills. Their needs, values, and learning must  also be taken into account – something the metanarrative of “for the students” ignores.

Faculty may also want to learn from and work with certain colleagues; the phrase “we should do something together,” spoken either in a research or a teaching context, refers first to the desire of faculty members to learn – and only secondarily to turning that faculty learning opportunity into a student learning opportunity as well. I made this point during a conversation with Jon.

MEL-J6: That's a way of saying that, and then also we'll say things to each other, like you and I even in this conversation, and I think in last week's conversation, say things like, "We should do something together sometime." (208)
JON 6: Yeah, that's the building interpersonal structures or what ever the word is there. (209)
MEL-J6: And it's clear from that statement that the important thing is, "Hey, I wanna do something with you, I kinda don't care what the something is, but I want it to be to you." (210)

The dataset narratives had many examples of faculty needs and values coming through in course design. For instance, Jon's personal interest in sustainability led him to look at design more broadly, and was the motivation for co-teaching an exploratory course on the topic in order to see how the idea could develop. (Jon 1) Alan described his cross-disciplinary background across both photography and the graphic and industrial arts as a way to explain his strong emphasis on aesthetics, which carries over into his teaching. “I think it might vary from faculty member to faculty member how much they place on aesthetics. I'm just saying from my perspective I put a LOT of value on something on how it looks.” (Alan 3, 208)

In many cases, faculty interests interact with student reactions, snowballing from informal engagements into the design of a formal curricular offering. Rob's narrative of the origins of the “Stuff of History” course reflect this. “Stuff of History” was a cross-disciplinary offering between History and Materials Science that was started by Rob and Jon after a serendipitous discovery of how they could work together. In the narrative that follows, notice how Rob's involvement is driven by the interests of the faculty members – he goes from a one-time class visitor to a three-time class visitor to the co-instructor of a new course, driven primarily by a sense of the faculty wanting to continue having fun together.

ROB 1: [Jon and two other faculty]... wanted to bring in a history of technology perspective... They said, "Rob, would you join us?" (214) Coming into their classroom was one of the biggest thrills I had in the first year... (216) [my visit] was supposed to happen once, and it [ended up as] a series of 3 visits. (222) So we ended up on the spot broadening my role a little bit... (223) It was a very early thrill for me that in some ways led me deeper into the idea of interdisciplinary integration which culminated into [teaching an] integrated course with Jon [called] Stuff of History, which was basically saying if we could have that much fun in a few sessions, what could we do with a whole course together? (225)

Faculty and student values, interests, and needs can interact to create a curricular environment. Rob Martello's origin story for the “Stuff of History” class begins with faculty interests in cross-disciplinary work. Rob gave a guest history lecture in a first-year engineering course where Materials Science professor Jon Stolk was a co-instructor. Students responded with tremendous energy to Rob's presence in their class, and dove deep into discussions of technology in a social context. The two faculty members subsequently decided to co-teach an entire integrated course together because the two of them had “that much fun.” Teaching the Stuff of History course satisfied multiple requirements from multiple stakeholders: students fulfilled both science and humanities requirements for graduation, Rob and Jon fulfilled their teaching load and their desire to work together, and everyone was able to explore cross-disciplinary ways of thinking and being, learn new things, and have more fun.

Of the faculty
-------------------
The identities/philosophies/values of the faculty designing and teaching a course leave imprints on their work. The same course taught by different faculty is not the same course at all; they are interchangeable in the same way that Joshua Bell and Itzhak Perlman are interchangeable as violin soloists.

DATA: Alan's photography background and valuing of aesthetics influencing his assessment criteria for student work

DATA: Rob's late arrival to history leading to his use of graduate pedagogy for undergrads

DATA: Mark's philosophy of letting students learn on their own leading to his "let them struggle" moments in the classroom

DATA: Jon's undergrad experiences leading to his course designs being an avoidance/wish-fulfillment

It goes get to the students eventually
-----------------------------------------
This doesn't contradict the "for the students" metanarrative; it can exist alongside it. Faculty learn things, and then they trickle out to students.

A3.txt:94:ALAN 3: I think when we're done teaching this course, the four of us, I think we'll be on the same page as far as design and what it means and what it means for our students. (94)

Example: Berea team teaching 130 so the faculty get on the same page - and eventually it'll improve the education of the students.

“We believe it's a good thing for our students to be able to design and make things,” said Alan. (Alan 3, 170) But where does this belief about what's “good for students” come from? According to Alan, it comes from the interests of the faculty themselves. “Every one of us [on the faculty] is more interested in design than we are in making things... and that's why we're focusing more on the design.” (Alan 3, 170)

This example illustrates something the metanarrative of “for the students” will not admit: faculty already put their own needs and values into the curriculum. Faculty design and choose and position their courses because they also have interests and desires. Faculty might desire to make it clear that they can teach advanced technical classes, or they may feel a particular affinity to teaching first-year students. They may want to learn about a specific topic themselves – how often have we heard the advice to teach a seminar class on a topic as a way to get ourselves to learn it?

There are many other examples of course design decisions being initiated around faculty needs and values rather than student ones. For instance, faculty members often go to conferences that necessitate them missing classes. Knowing this in advance, faculty design their course schedules so that “professor is at a conference week” also happens to be “guest lecture week” or “open project work week.” The faculty begin that design step (cite: “design step” or “design move” is maybe helpful terminology here) with their own needs as the primary constraint, then designed around it so it would work well for students. Similarly, a faculty member doing education research may design a course as an experiment and collect student data from it to see the effect the teaching technique has on them. The course design is designed as much for the faculty's research and publication-related promotion as it is the students' learning.

We cannot remove our values, opinions, and embodied ways of being from the courses we create. As a non-hearing faculty member, all my courses will be deaf-accessible even if I have only hearing students in my classroom. We also hear unfortunate stories of faculty members who consciously or unconsciously use their classrooms to reproduce their beliefs about the outwards characteristics of engineers – that they should belong to a certain gender, class, sexuality, or race. On the other hand, a faculty member who is feminist may decide to specifically conduct a dicussion on gender in the classroom at the start of a thermodynamics lecture.
