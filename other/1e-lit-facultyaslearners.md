(Huge insight from Sebastian: the title of this lit review section is actually "faculty as learners." Need to reorg functional spec based on that.)

In this section, we will discuss what we mean by "faculty," how faculty are situated and communal learners, and the nature of the context and community they learn with and within.

Julia and I are both looking to facilitate and value a particular sort of transformative experience in engineering education. Her focus is service learning, and as part of that, she wants to work with faculty. My focus is faculty development.

What, precisely, do we mean by “these sorts of experiences”? (Words we’ve used: transformative, whole-person, ontological, reflective, emergent, making-space.)

How have those ideas and experiences shown up in the history of faculty development — who has done this before, what did they do, and how have they written about it? (High

How have those ideas and experiences interacted (or not) with the way engineering education researchers write and think about faculty development?

What do we mean when we say "faculty"?
------------------------------------------

### What is a faculty member?

In order to understand faculty as learners, we must first examine what a faculty member is and how their roles are positioned within the academic world they work in. AAUP, the American Association of University Professors, defines faculty members as "members of the instructional-research staff who are employed full time... \[and] whose major regular assignment (at least 50 percent) is instruction, including release time for research." (AAUP, 2015) Notably, the AAUP defines faculty roles by function, not by title; anyone fitting that definition is included regardless of whether their formal institutional title is "faculty."
 
### Who is and isn't a faculty member?

According to the AAUP definition, faculty on sabbatical are counted; temporary replacements for faculty on paid leave are not counted. Part-time employees, administative officers such as librarians, deans, or coaches, and graduate and undergraduate teaching assistants are not counted.

### What do faculty do?

From the AAUP definition, we see that faculty job duties include, but are not limited to, the instruction of postsecondary students. In the case of engineering and technology faculty, this role specifically includes formation of engineering and technology students. 

(TODO: What else do faculty do? Expand on research, teaching, service -- where did these come from? CITE: Humboldt)

This model for the life of the professorate comes to us from Wilhelm von Humboldt’s vision for the university, the 19th century “Bildungsideal” (literally, "higher-education-ideal"). The dual and symbiotic roles of teacher-scholar, the concept of academic freedom, and the autonomy to teach one’s classroom as one wishes all come from Humboldt’s views on the Enlightenment. (Humboldt, YYYY) His intent was to create vital and thinking citizens of the world, allowing individuals to develop themselves in an environment of intellectual freedom.

How are faculty members situated and communal learners?

### Faculty as situated and communal learners in existing engineering education literature

Faculty learning does not happen in a vacuum; it is situated in a particular context. That context is academia, both broadly as an institutional format that has been around for many years, and specifically in an individual faculty's disciplinary and campus culture. Faculty learning does not happen in isolation; faculty are also situated within their disciplinary and campus communities.

Situated cognition and communities of practice are learning theories that can help us understand these particulars of the faculty learning experience. (EXPAND ON SITUATED COGNITION)

Faculty can be seen as participants in a cognitive apprenticeship (Collins, Brown, & Newman, 1987). The cognitive apprenticeship framework was developed alongside theories of situated cognition and communities of practice (CoP) in the late 1980s and early 1990s. If situated learning says that all knowledge is contextual (Brown et al, 1989), and communities of practice are the domain-specific groups of practitioners with whom we share a fellowship (Wenger, 1999), then cognitive apprenticeships are how newcomers learn a contextually-situated intellectual craft by working with and observing others in a CoP. Faculty, especially novice faculty or those new to a particular school, can be thought of as apprentices who learn from watching more-seasoned faculty navigate the practice of teaching engineering.

### Existing use of situated and communal learning in engineering education research

Situated learning and CoPs are not new ideas in engineering education. In “Situated Engineering Learning: Bridging Engineering Education Research and the Learning Sciences,” Johri and Olds (2011) provide numerous examples of how situated learning is already embedded in engineering education by virtue of its emphasis on tangible, real-world, hands-on project work. CoP theory is even more widely used in engineering education, including usage specifically geared towards faculty development. For example, the NSF-funded Rigorous Research in Engineering Education (RREE) workshops were based on a CoP model (Streveler, Smith, & Miller, 2005). Engineering education conferences feature workshops and special sessions with titles such as “Feminist engineering education: building a community of practice” (Pawley et al., 2009) and “Communities in practice in engineering education: what are we learning?” (Adams et al., 2005). While not limited to engineering or technology faculty, the Faculty Learning Community (FLC) movement within faculty development has been described as a specific type of CoP (Cox, 2004). Finally, the American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE) is developing a NSF-funded virtual CoP model for faculty, citing familiar-sounding frustrations with the “inherent limitations” of the “develop-disseminate” model in which researchers develop new materials “and then try to convince others to use them… without any follow-up activity,” (Pimmel et al., 2013, p. 2).

### Cognitive apprenticeships as communal and situated learning within a community of practice

Apprenticeship-style learning takes place within the practice it seeks to modify. The creators of cognitive apprenticeship theory were education researchers inspired by anthropological observations of traditional craft apprenticeships such as building furniture or delivering babies. They noticed that apprentices developed their skills in a meaningful context where their novice efforts clearly contributed to the “real practice” of their craft and the building of their skill in that craft (Brown, Collins, & Duguid, 1989). Reading or talking about designing engineering curricula is not the same thing as actually designing or teaching it, one possible reason the engineering education research-to-practice transfer problem is more difficult than a information dissemination perspective might make it sound (Siddiqui & Adams, 2013).

Cognitive apprenticeships also differ from the “information dissemination” approach through their emphasis on the social aspect of learning; learners are surrounded by other learners and multiple models of expertise (Collins, Brown, & Newman, 1987). How could the apprenticeship-style learning from traditional crafts be transferred to the development of cognitive skills such as teaching and curriculum development? One large divide needs to be bridged: the difference between cognitive and traditional apprenticeship is that cognitive apprenticeship focuses on cognitive and metacognitive, not physical, skills. Apprenticeships, argued Collins and his co-authors, exposed the process of creation to apprentices; a young man would see his teacher sanding a cabinet, a young woman would watch her teacher wrap a newborn child. It’s somewhat harder to “see” what goes on inside a faculty member’s head when (for instance) they are reconceptualizing what it means to teach design across the disciplines. 

Since cognitive activity is not visible by default, teachers of intellectual subjects would need to practice “making thinking visible,” or “the externalization of processes that are usually carried out internally... to bring these tacit processes into the open." (Collins, Brown, & Holum, 1991, p. 6) In effect, Collins and his coauthors were saying that facilitating cognitive apprenticeships is all about making one’s metacognition visible to learners in one’s CoP.

### The goals of cognitive apprenticeships are metacognition and self-monitoring

Regardless of the specific techniques employed, the ultimate goal of cognitive apprenticeship is the development of metacognition and self-monitoring in students – or as Donald Schön would put it, the ability of reflection-in-action (1983). Developing this ability enables practitioners to serve as “teachers” to one another; faculty can help other faculty develop without being faculty development specialists or even “expert” practitioners of teaching or curriculum design themselves. The only requirement is that the practitioner is self-aware enough to articulate their own performance, including their mistakes. For this reason, I have used the word “practitioner” rather than “teacher” in describing the cognitive apprenticeship techniques, unlike Collins and his colleagues, who were writing for an audience of K-12 teachers and education researchers.

### Limitations of the cognitive apprenticeship perspective: ignoring the agency and experiences of adult learners

It is here that we find one of the major limitations of the cognitive apprenticeship framework in thinking about faculty-as-learners: it was developed in a context where the learners were children, whereas engineering and technology faculty are adults. Agency is thus implicitly assumed to originate with the “teacher,” eventually flowing outward to the learner. This is evident not just in phrases such as “give students the opportunity” (Collins, Brown, & Newman, 1987, p. 18) and “create a culture… for students” (p. 7), but in the techniques themselves — “modeling” is a predominantly passive act on the part of the learner, and “scaffolding” and “fading” are simply the deliberate and gradual transfer of agency to the learner. The end goal is for the student to have agency, to allow “the role of ‘expert’ and ‘student’ to be transformed,”(Collins, Brown, & Holum, 1991, p. 17) — but it does not start out that way. 

However, Jane Vella’s 1997 book points out that adult learners must be seen as subjects rather than objects in learning from the very beginning (p. 129-148); they are already used to acting as independent agents and bring a rich storehouse of past experiences to the table. Baxter-Magolda and King describe such learners as self-authoring (Baxter-Magolda 7 King, 2004), which means they take responsibility for their own beliefs, sense of self, and relationships with others.

What is the context and community they learn within?
------------------------------------------------------

In the current dominant model of the American university, this includes direct classroom experience and contact with students, some degree of autonomy regarding how to teach them, and the expectation of an intellectual life outside the classroom.
