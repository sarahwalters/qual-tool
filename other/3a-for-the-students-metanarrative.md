# The curricular design metanarrative of “for the students, by the faculty”

Our faculty narratives contain many narratives -- many happenings and many viewpoints on those happenings. Some of these viewpoints can be characterized as metanarratives. Recall from the previous chapter that a metanarrative is a totalizing narrative; it is a story that excludes other variants. One recurring narrative around curricular design is that it is “for the students.” 

In the “for the students” narrative, curriculum, students, and faculty are treated as three separate things and placed in particular roles relative to each other: faculty are makers of curriculum, students are recipients of curriculum, and the curriculum is something that is created by and applied to someone or something other than itself. This narrative is not inherently harmful and actually carries great benefits as a way of making sense of faculty roles, including faculty as learners. It is only dangerous as a limiting factor when it becomes a metanarrative and excludes alternative narratives..

## What the “for the students” narrative looks like

Before examining something as a metanarrative, it must first be a narrative. The “for the students” narrative can be obvious and told in full within one sentence. Any time a faculty narrator tells a story with faculty as the primary characters, the curriculum as the primary object those characters are acting on, and the students as the intended beneficiaries of those actions, they are encapsulating the entire “for the students” metanarrative. For instance, Rob summarized his early days as a faculty member at Olin in the following way:

We were doing something exciting and dynamic to roll out the curriculum and break the mold while doing a good job for our students, helping them get a good education and not be hurt because they were guinea pigs.” (Rob 1, 122) 

The “we” in his sentence refers to the early Olin faculty, of which he was a member. Those faculty members were creating a brand-new curriculum that would be applied to students. Rob describes the students as guinea pigs, which evokes images of scientific experimentation -- the students as subjects that the curriculum would be applied to, as if it were a medication with unknown side effects. His phrasing of making sure the students would “not be hurt” indicates a protectiveness towards them, as if the faculty were the dynamic agents who needed to watch out for students who might not be able to fully protect themselves.

Jon also portrayed the “for the students” narrative in full, albeit in a more theatrical way. When portraying faculty conversations at Olin before students arrived on campus, he said:

Actually, the way that a lot of faculty phrased or responded to the question [of curricular design]was they would say things to the effect of, "Well the most important thing for students is," and then blah blah blah. (Jon 3, 154)

Jon’s quote collapses all the early Olin faculty into a single imaginary speaker talking about a semi-hypothetical group of “students” that is implied to be homogenous. Jon’s imaginary faculty speaker feels like she or he can make authoritative statements on what would benefit students the most. He doesn’t specify the thing that would be most beneficial -- in fact, Jon’s use of “blah blah blah” as a generic placeholder might imply that these imaginary faculty would have diverse answers -- the important thing is that the faculty are speaking as the people who will be making the curricular decisions “for students.”

The “for the students” narrative was used as a way of framing the past; it was also used as a way to describe aspirations for the future, as in Mark’s explanation of TAD’s future direction:

Hopefully in the near future we will be taking direction and initiatives to... make the changes across the curriculum to benefit the students. (Mark 1, 22) 

Again, the students are portrayed as beneficiaries rather than co-authors of the changes to the curriculum. The faculty are the ones taking direction and taking initiative; students are in other, more passive roles with respect to the curriculum.

Even when the narrative is not evoked in full, its fingerprints show up everywhere across the statements faculty make. For example, Lynn spoke about “designing for student engagement” and being “student-centered” (Lynn 6, 95). Faculty are to “doing the best we can for students now” (Mark 1, 18) while “look[ing] more towards the future, what we want these students to do later and that kind of thing.” (Rob 4, 213). Rob also speaks of a professor in the midst of executing the design curriculum, “talking about design,” and having a moment “where the light bulb goes off for students.” (Rob 1, 221) These statements fit the expected roles of faculty in the “for the students” metanarrative; faculty are the benevolent creators of curricular design, ideally always keeping student benefit in mind. Jon gives us an example of the faculty member as the “main character” of the curricular design narrative:

I was always flexible enough in my course designs to accommodate that sort of thing... I was able to… adjust on the fly to make for a better experience for students. (Jon 3, 116)

This narrative fragment portrays Jon as an individual faculty hero doing responsive course design in the moment to make “a better experience for students.” Groups of faculty can be portrayed as having a similar common aim, as Gary shows:

So, team teaching, that was a big piece to figure out what people understood… and what they felt was the most important pieces, and how to negotiate that to then come up with the best content for the students. (Gary 3, 92)

Even if faculty are not explicitly named in this passage, the “people” involved in “team teaching” are clearly faculty members. Gary portrays them as coming together and working towards the “best” things they could create “for the students,” as if student benefit were a guiding compass the faculty could keep before their eyes at all times.

Statements about the curriculum also fit its role in the “for the students” metanarrative: the curriculum is a thing that is designed and redesigned by faculty for the benefit of students. When Alan described “the main goal” of an early version of TAD 130 as being “for students to learn how to use that piece of software (Adobe Inventor),” (Alan 2, 17) he’s depicting a curricular design goal centered around student learning. Even when he speaks of the same course being revised towards different learning goals, they’re still learning goals for the students to achieve, rather than goals for faculty learning per se.

That's been flipped... [now] it's a design course where Inventor happens to be our tool that we use to design with… We have students design something based on five criteria and then we'll change the criteria and have them redesign the exact same object with different criteria so it looks totally different..." (Alan 2, 17-19)

The TAD faculty did the curricular “flipping,” or redesign. The course goals may be dramatically different now, oriented towards design process and creative thinking rather than simple skill-building, but it’s still something directed towards students. Although students are portrayed as performing a complex design task, the assigment of those tasks are initiated and dictated by faculty, who “have students design something” and then “have them redesign” it later on. Similarly, Gary speaks of the motivation behind part of a TAD course redesign as starting “...in our senior research [course, where] getting students to do an iteration was almost impossible.” (Gary 3, 81)  Here, faculty must “get students” to “do an iteration;” Gary’s complaint is that students are not taking this action of their own accord.

Statements about students also fit the “for the students” narrative template: they are recipients of curricular design, which is explicitly not their responsibility. Gary described disagreements among TAD faculty about a course design in this way:

So that was stuff that we had to hash out among ourselves, or try to hash out among ourselves. And I hope that that didn't show up to the students… (Gary 3, 57)

The students aren’t supposed to be involved in “hashing out” curricular design issues. They should be focused on other things, such as the learning objectives the faculty are responsible for designing for them. Faculty are depicted as protecting students from the “hashing out” as a distraction by doing it only “among themselves.” When issues do come up, they are framed against student benefit, as in Mark’s description of a terminology debate amongst TAD faculty that was witnessed by the students in one class:

...it was beneficial for the students, for their own sake, to see different interpretations and different applications of design. (Mark 2, 142)

The “for the students” narrative portrays the faculty as having a writerly approach to the curriculum; faculty are not only allowed to rethink and modify it, they are actively driven to take initiative on doing so. In contrast, the silent implication is that students are expected to take a readerly approach; they consume or experience the curriculum designed for them rather than actively collaborating to shape it.

## What does the “for the students” narrative do?
Now that I’ve presented several examples of the “for the students” narrative so you can get a feel for what it looks like in faculty stories, let’s step back and look at what the narrative implies. The grammatical underpinnings of the sentences provide clues to the underlying assumptions the narrators are making about the nature of their world. These assumptions take the form of an ontology, or a conceptualization of the nature of being and reality. The ontology presented in the “for the students” narrative fits a familiar and “progressive” model in engineering design -- that of user-centered design. This section will examine these claims in turn.

### Step-through debugger: examining the grammar of narratives
Most of the “for the students” narratives above are fairly obvious to the casual reader in terms of fitting the pattern. The process of pattern-matching is largely unconscious to the fluent reader of stories. Before examining the underlying ontology revealed by this narrative pattern, it is valuable to examine the mechanism by which readers determine whether the narrative fits this pattern. That mechanism can give us clues on how narrators draw their ontological boundaries, and in turn imply how those boundaries might be redrawn and blured.

One way of explaning the unconscious mechanism we use to recognize a “for the students” narrative pattern is by taking a grammatical approach. Grammatical clues, particularly the assignment of names and pronouns to contrast groups with one another, can give a savvy reader clues about the assumptions an author is making about the world. This work of tracing characters and pronouns was previously discussed in the methods section and is presented again in context here.

In a narrative sense, tracing names and pronouns is like pulling out a cast of characters from a story: who is the main character, and who are the supporting characters or villains? What underlying transformation does a name change signify? What relationships do characters have to one another -- are there clusters of characters who form families, armies, or teams that interact with one another? Is there a chorus?

In a technical sense, tracing names and pronouns is like attending to variable assignment in a software program. The reader does the work of a step-through debugger, which keeps track of values assigned to each storage location with each step through the program. Blending the technical and narrative approaches, we end up with a sort of step-through story tracker, where we keep track of characters, types of characters, and what we know about those characters. The table below presents these parallels.

Technical equivalent
Narrative equivalent
What memory locations are there, and what are they called (variable names)? 
What characters/groups are there, and what are they named?
What type of data is stored in each memory location (and by extension, what data types are possible?)
What sort of people are each of these characters (and by extension, what sorts of people are there in this world?)


What value is stored in each memory location? How does it change?
What do we know about each of these characters? How does that change?

Here is one small example of a detailed grammar step-through of a “for the students” narrative instance. It is a segment where Mark discusses curricular revision conversations with industry in the context of a student complaint.

So though I feel for the student... I don't know if there's any way to really convey what our students can do... So to address that, we're doing a couple things. We are meeting -- we are planning to meet in the near future with people from various industries… [about the] future direction of the program. (Mark 2, 175-177)

By stepping through the narrative’s pronouns, we can show that Mark’s words refer to TAD faculty as the people doing the revision. For instance, when he says “we are planning to meet in the near future with people from various industries… [about the] future direction of the program” (Mark 2, 176-177), the “we” he is discussing only includes TAD faculty. Students have been excluded from this “we,” and aren’t intended to come along to those meetings.

The characters and their references in this narrative excerpt are as follows:

Narrative excerpt
How is the character referred to?
Which character is being discussed?
I feel...
I
Mark as an individual faculty
...for the student...
the student
The individual student who made the complaint
I don't know if...
I
Mark as an individual faculty
...what our students can do...
we (“our” is the possessive form of “we”)
The group of all TAD faculty
...what our students can do...
students
The group of TAD students (who “belong” to the TAD faculty)
...we're doing a couple things.
we
The group of all TAD faculty
We are meeting -- we are planning to meet...
we
The group of all TAD faculty
...with people from various industries...
“people from various industries”
The group of industry people

Pronouns can be thought of like variable assignments; they mean nothing unless they are explicitly used to refere to a particular person or group, and then they remain pointing to that value until they are explicitly reassigned. From this, we can see that the “we” in “we are meeting” is the group of TAD faculty, since that is what the pronoun was last assigned to.

Students have been explicilty separated from that pronoun, and thus from the group of people going to discuss the curriculum with industry representatives. Early in the excerps, Mark separates the student from himself (“I feel for the student,”) then separates the group of students from the group of faculty he includes himself in, since “our students” implies a group (“our/we/us”) who possesses, and therefore is separate from, another group (“students”). The “our” depicted in that first-person plural is the group of TAD faculty, which remains the first-person plural discussed as the “we” who are “doing a couple things” and “planning to meet” with industry about the “future direction of the program.” 

### Grammar implies an underlying ontology to the “for the students” narrative: self/world/other

The grammar step-through makes-explicit an unconscious process fluent readers go through as they read. Going through this process can help make-visible assumptions being made about what types of roles characters in the narrative world fit into, and how characters in those roles are assumed to interact. Assumptions about the nature and categorization of being, as well as the relationships between categories of being, are called ontological assumptions. Therefore, this process can reveal the underying ontology of faculty narrators. 

In fact, just the underlying structure of the narrative’s summary is revealing: “Faculty make curriculum for the students.” Grammatically speaking, faculty are agents, the subjects of the sentence who do the designing, take the initiative, and roll out the curriculum. Students are indirect objects and recipients of the curriculum, “guinea pigs” to run through an experiment. The curriculum is a direct object that is made and changed by the faculty. 

The depicted ontology has three distinct categories: faculty, curriculum, and students. Since the narratives are told from the perspective of the faculty, as illustrated by the use of both singular and plural first-person pronouns (I, myself, me, we, our, etc.), the “faculty” category can be framed as “self.” The student category, in contrast, is an “other” -- a group of people who are not faculty. The curriculum is an artifact created by faculty for students, but not just any type of artifact; it is an immersive experience and an environment to live in rather than a concrete object that can be passed from hand to hand. By defining the curriculum as the totality of the created learning environment, I am framing the curriculum as a “world.” This fits into discussions of learning that go beyond formal course content objectives and recognize things like extracurricular activities, faculty modeling of professionalism, and revelations of a bias-laden “hidden curriclum” (Anyon, 1980), both positive and negative, as being relevant to student learning. The end result is an ontology of self (faculty), world (curriculum) and other (students).

### Self/world/other ontology as a natural consequence of the typical flow of curricular design

This ontology of self/world/other seems reasonable, especially in light of the way curricular design tends to unfold in time. Typically, faculty begin designing courses before students show up to take them. This was the case with the curricular design stories told by the faculty narrators in this study. For example, Olin narrators designed courses for students who had not yet arrived on campus: 

The first year, when we really just had desiging the curriculum on our agenda. We didn't have to spend time teaching. We could devote 100% of resources to planning, research, to creation knowing that the following September we would open our doors to the students. (Rob 1, 131) 

TAD narrators hastily put together their design course in the summer before teaching it in the fall:

We planned the first week, the half-week that school was... We literally planned enough for the first two days of class. We met that Friday, planned next week, met the next Friday, planned next week. And just this past weekend, I came out with a three-week plan or at least a trajectory... (Mark 3, 193)

Narrators tell about actively working to stay one step ahead of their students. By the time students walk in on the first day of class, things about the curriculum have typically been at least somewhat put in place. Faculty walk into the room with a syllabus, a plan, an agenda, and expectations, no matter how quickly-assembled, tenuous, and subject to change those items are. The ontology of faculty-self as preparing and pre-designing a curriculum-world for receiving student-others is an entirely reasonable outgrowth of this process.

### The “for the students” ontology fits the user-centered design (UCD) model

One of the advantages of the underlying self/world/other ontology is that it fits into existing best practices for design. In the design world, Donald Norman’s book “The Design of Everyday Things” (1986) introduced the term “user-centered design” (UCD), which suggested privileging the needs, values, and viewpoints of users. UCD, sometimes under the name “human-centric design” or other similar variants, has been widely adopted by designers, including those in the field of engineering and technology. 

UCD has also been adopted as a curricular design approach across multiple disciplines, including engineering and technology. Wiggins and McTighe’s book “Understanding by Design” (2005) steps curricular designers through a UCD process; Dee Fink’s book “Creating Significant Learning Experiences” (2003) provides a taxonomy for outcomes embedded in a UCD process. Effectively, the applicaiton of UCD to curricular design frames the curriculum as the product/experience being designed, students as users of the curriculum, and faculty as designers of the curriculum.

One key part of the UCD philosophy is involving users in the process of design. In the case of curricular design, this means involving students in the process of making curricular design decisions. The “for the students” narrative does not exclude this possibility. However, it does constrain it. In the two examples below, Mark and Rob describe a feedback process that involves students, but in faculty-defined roles. 

if we're going to listen to the students, which I think we should, and I welcome their input, it's also taking it for what it is and where it comes from. (Mark 2, 301)

And I have a few feedback moments... "Let's take 20 minutes at the end of class and do a Plus/Delta kind of thing... Hey, what do you think of that reading?" But that's it, it in terms of feedback, that's all. (Rob 5, 219)

Mark talks about “we,” the faculty, “listen[ing] to the students” and welcoming “their input,” which keeps students as a distinct group whose input is subject to the judgment of faculty before it affects the curriculum. Faculty also have to filter student input for “what it is,” translating it into something appropriate for the course. Similarly, Rob’s feedback moments as described here are faculty-initiated: “Let’s take 20 minutes…” and faculty-structured, as in the case of the Plus/Delta activity. Students offer feedback and otherwise participate in curricular design as a way to help faculty design courses “for the students,” and these sorts of “user” roles are entirely appropriate within the framing of UCD.

UCD is not an unfamiliar approach to the Olin and TAD narrators. The design curriculum at Olin College is heavily centered around UCD, a framing that recurs in Olin faculty narratives and in the title of one of its design courses, “User Oriented Collaborative Design.” Moreover, the entire TAD faculty attended a curricular design workshop by Dee Fink the summer I was there; I participated in the workshop with them and watched them step their courses through Fink’s version of the UCD process. It is therefore unsurprising that the “for the studnets” narrative should resonate through Olin and TAD faculty stories; their roles in that narrative are te same as their roles as portrayed by the UCD process when applied to curricular design.

## Positive aspects of the “for the students” narrative

The “for the students” narrative is an entirely reasonable way to make sense of the world. It is not in and of itself a bad thing, and I do not intend to argue for its elimination. In fact, there are many positive aspects to it. 

First of all, responding to student needs is a laudable goal for the curricular design process. The UCD philosophy in product design was driven by the observation that taking user needs and values into account leads to more successfully adopted products. Similarly, as Glassick et al have pointed out, an increasingly diverse student population has created a growing need for deliberate instructional design on the part of the professoriate, who could previously assume they were instructing a more homogenous group much like themselves (1997, p. 8).

The focus on curricular design “for the students” and their needs and backgrounds in engineering education can be seen as a response to a history that didn’t work so well. Engineering education researchers critique the passive, lecture-based approach to pedagogy. Under what some call the “traditional” paradigm, faculty simply taught, and assumed students would learn, without deliberately thinking about how the design of their teaching might influence the learning of their students. The “for the students” narrative is an explicit counter to the meritocratic, content-centered attitude that the smartest students will learn the material and the weaker ones will “weed out.” Faculty can influence student engagement and retention by designing courses that fit their learning needs and interest.

### Positive: understanding and getting to know students becomes a priority.

The idea of “understanding your users” is prominent in the UCD philosophy. If our students are users, faculty-designers must work to understand their students so they can take student needs and backgrounds into account. For example, Alan recognized that students may enter TAD courses from high school where they are used to a less hands-on learning style, and is ready to be patient: "...that's a different way of learning and it may take students a while to catch on to that..." (Alan 1, 46) He also commented on TAD's adaptation to students coming in with less and less industrial arts experience over time:

...back in, you know, 70s, 80s and even up until the 90s most schools had industrial arts programs. So students would take industrial arts in high school and really like it. If they come to college they come already knowing how to do woodworking and already knowing how to do metal, knowing how to weld... [Then] schools started eliminating their industrial arts programs because of financial reasons. [Now] we have to start at a level where... I assume... they've never had it before because most of them will not. (Alan 1, 48-49, 55)

Instead of penalizing students for coming in with less background, Alan describes a situation where the facutly shifted the curricular design to meet them where they were. Gary, himself an alumni of the TAD program at Berea, also spoke of sensitivity to the nature of the student population as an important factor in TAD’s curricular design. His curricular design philosophy is tightly intertwined with his observations of TAD students learning and responding to the current curriculum and what they walk in the door with.

And then you had to understand your student population and the regions that they were coming from… And the baggage and the hope and all of the stuff that they were bringing with them. (Gary 1, 79, 81)

Gary’s phrasing hints at his recognition that he has a wide variety of incoming students. He refers to multiple “regions” that students come from, as well as “baggage” and “hope” and other “stuff” that tends to be intensely personal and individual. When reading TAD transcripts later on, Rob immediately picked up on “understanding students” as a skill implied by Gary’s comment, and his response is wistful:

...at Olin, we try to do that, but it's such a moving target. We don't have a lot of students. It's very hard to characterize them in one way… so we're not left with the very good model of that, of understanding the students. I'd love to hear them talk about how well they understand their students when they first arrive... Just because I think Olin can learn a lot from them, in that regard. (Rob 4, 208-209, 214)

Spurred by Gary’s statement, Rob comments extensively on how he wishes Olin could learn how to “understand students” better. This is an indication that “understanding students” is something Rob values highly as a faculty member. Rob, Jon, and Lynn have also co-facilitated a workshop for engineering faculty where one of the learning toals is to "understand and empathize with your students and their experience” (Collaboratory, 2015). The drive to understand students and their needs can spur faculty to build relationships with their students, which positively impacts student outcomes; Kuh’s analysis of the National Survey of Student Engagement (2002) showed a correlation between student success and student-faculty interaction.

### Positive: curricular design decisions have a clear focus.

When curricular designs are made “for the students,” faculty-designers have a clear focus for all of their teaching-related activities. Gary states this point of view directly when he says that “Everything, I don't know, from my point of view then should be focused on getting the students to where a good place would be” (Gary 1, 81). Even external engagements and activities are brought “back home” by tying them to the common thread of designing “for the students.” For example, Gary spends a substantial amount of time outside the TAD division, and told of his journeys elsewhere on campus as well as at off-campus conferences with respect to how it impacted student learning:

And then I spent quite a bit of time to look at what the rest of the campus was doing as far as other majors, how they had structured their programs and how that was working. Then tried to bring some of that back to our faculty, and then to bring reports back from conferences that I would attend that would be discussing about curriculum change and what was shaping our profession, and to try to show people this is what's going on. Now what can we do that might be better for our students that could just be a better way to present this content. (Gary 1, 89)

Even as he journeys away from his students, Gary keeps them in mind. His intent is always to “bring some of that back” in order to discuss how TAD might do things “that might be better for our students.” 

Similarly, curricular design decisions must have a student-focused rationale behind them. Changing for the sake of change, rather than for the benefit of the students, will be viewed with caution. Mark discussed Gary’s focus on student-prioritized curricular change. At TAD, student benefit is a filter for what changes are considered worth making.

And I know [Gary is] willing to, but he's not gonna change just for the sake of change. And he's made that very clear many, many times. And it's very easy for [younger faculty to say], "Ooh. We got this new great idea", and Gary tends to stop and say, "Well, what is so good about it? Where's the evidence?" It's cautious... I think you need to have that. Otherwise, you'd just be changing for the sake of change, and not changing for the benefit of the program and benefit of the students. (Mark 3, 37-38)

We can see evidence of faculty learning in the above quote. In this case, the younger faculty are learning about the “for the students” narrative as a key part of TAD’s curricular design culture. Gary, as a more experienced faculty member, is acting as a teacher of culture in reminding the younger faculty of the values they are supposed to be prioritizing. 

### Positive: faculty have a point of unity.

Having students as the first priority makes it easier to let go of other things that are then given less priority. When resources are finite, the focus on students becomes a way to make choices about curricular design. With  When discussing the new department space and the inevitable debates around how it should be structured, Mark portrays the students as a central point that determines the allocation of a limited budget.

I'm like, "Well, sorry, but we have a budget limit, and we need to do stuff that's for the students, not because you need it." (Mark 3, 66)

The philosophy of UCD dictates that user values and needs should take priority over the needs and values of other groups of people. In this case, student needs and values take priority over faculty ones if there is a conflict between the two. Mark spoke directly to this philosophy:

MARK 2: And, you know, it's one of those things that I think everyone... I can't speak for everyone on this campus… but a fair majority of it -- if you say we're working on this for the sake of our students, boom. You have the attention of the room. You know, in one way, shape, or form. (133)

Mark portrays the “for the students” narrative as a standard held by “a fair majority” of his campus. Culturally, it is something that can be used to bring people together when their attention is diffuse. The phrase “for the sake of our students” seems almost like a magical incantation that can capture (“boom”) the resources of a diverse group of people because they have agreed to use it as a codeword. Similar to shouting “fire” or yelling “fore” on a golf course, phrases like “for the students” have a cultural encoding. In this case, “for the students” carries the underlying message of: “this is important, and you should stop what you’re doing and pay attention to it.” It is a potential point of nucleation and unity if conflicts should arise.

Additionally, a focus on student needs can help multiple faculty come to a consensus on curricular design. “The 6 of us have yet to sit down and come down to an idea [about the curriculum],” Mark pointed out. (Mark 1, 96) However, with the shared culture of the “for the students” narrative, they can assume they can use that as a starting point in discussion with the other faculty. If student needs become the standard by which the design is judged, the faculty have something in common to rally around, while preserving their individualism. “[A successful curriculum means] not that we all have the same ideas and likemindedness, but [that] at least for the curriculum we agree what we will do next for the benefit of the students.” (Mark 1, 35) Of course, this implies that faculty members have a common understanding of what would be to the benefit of students. We will return to this topic in a later section.

### Positive: motivate growth and change

Another benefit of the student-centered focus is that it can motivate faculty members to grow and change in order to serve students more effectively. In other words, the “for the students” narrative motivates faculty to learn whatever they believe will serve students better. Sometimes, noticing their deviance from the “for the students” narrative serves as the first flag that faculty learning needs to occur. Jon describes one such moment during an in-class experience where students were independently doing work in their design studio:

[My colleague] and I are sitting on our laptops doing some other work, next to each other, hanging out and having a conversation and getting a little work done while students are on their own and we looked at each other and had this moment, Oh shit we are not doing anything useful and certainly not helping our students in any way. (Jon 1, 123)

Jon is describing a co-teaching experience where he was doing very normal faculty activities, “sitting on… laptops doing… work.” The activity is productive and clearly part of his faculty job; he and his co-instructor are “getting a little work done.” It is only when they realize that they are “not helping… students in any way” that they see their actions as wrong. Even if they are “getting… work done,” they are “not doing anything useful” because they are violating the narrative that they, as faculty, ought to be doing things “for the students” in the context of their classroom time. This moment spurs Jon and his co-instructor to make immediate changes in what they are doing, and they proceed to re-focus around helping students in the course more directly.

The “for the students” narrative enables faculty to tell a story about their own learning; instead of being an individual effort, their growth contributes towards a goal shared and valued by their surrounding culture. Stories of personal transformation can be linked not only to the individual’s growth, but to the growth of the local faculty community. One example occurred during Mark’s first interview, where he talked about the importance of the other faculty developing a "thick skin" to criticism like his own. Several months later, he had revised his position, saying:

...something I realized... just because I can take constructive criticism and because of the thick skin I have doesn't mean other people have to or it's fair that they should. (Mark 2, 112-113)
 
This is a personal realization from Mark; he realized that his individual viewpoint of having a “thick skin” was in conflict with something else he valued more highly. However, he ties his realization to a group narrative for the entire TAD division by connecting it to the “for the students” narrative:

Let’s talk about the goals of the classes, the goals for our students, what we want to achieve, and how we go about doing that. What ways do we do that successfully, and how do we improve? (Mark 2, 117) 

Mark shifts from separating himself from other faculty to uniting himself with them. Previously, he held himself up as an example of someone with “thick skin” as a skill his colleagues should also adopt. Now he speaks about “us” and “we” -- “what we want to achieve” and “how we go about doing that.” The common value of “goals for our students” was more important than Mark’s prior individual desire to have others develop a “thick skin,” and motivated him to undergo that conceptual transition.

## Why is this a metanarrative and not just a narrative?

The “for the students” narrative is a reasonable way to make sense of the curricular design process, and carries many benefits with it. However, like all narratives, it can turn into a metanarrative, a totalizing narrative that excludes the possibility of other explanations. There is evidence that the “for the students” narrative acts as a metanarrative in faculty stories.

Metanarrative evidence is typically subtle, since it is an argument that points out an exclusion. However, there are times where faculty narrators explicitly rejected alternate narratives in favor of the “for the students” one. For example, Mark’s first interview rejected the alternate narrative that curriculum might be “about the faculty” by contrasting it to the “correct” narrative of “for the students”:

I understand [curriculum] is not about me, it is for the benefit of the students… It is not about you, it is not about me, it is for the students. If you are doing something wrong or maybe something could help them better, why wouldn't you. (Mark 1, 191, 210)

Mark presents the “incorrect” narrative as incorrect not once, but multiple times. It is not “about you” and it is not “about me,” the correct answer is that it is “for the students.” His question of “why wouldn’t you?” implies an expectation that his faculty colleagues will similarly pursue the correct answer, which is to do things “for the students.” Implicit in Mark’s statement is that being “for the students” -- or not -- is what makes a faculty action something right or “something wrong.”

Mark’s statement also contains clues about what the “for the students” narrative excludes if it becomes a metanarrative. Curriculum is not about faculty needs, either individually or as a group. It may not always be appropriate to prioritize student needs over faculty needs -- for instance, if a faculty member is a member of a minority group and her or his students are not, this does not remove the legitimate need of the faculty member to have a safe and accessible environment in the classroom. For example, I am deaf and sometimes use ASL interpretation in the classroom. I overwhelmingly teach hearing students who don’t understand sign language at all. The “for the students” metanarrative de-centers my needs for access and makes it difficult to start a dialogue on how to integrate interpreting or captioning into my curricular designs.

The “for the students” metanarrative also de-centers evidence of faculty learning. For example, it sweeps terminology conflicts and prior iterations of a course under the rug. Gary’s description of the chaos that comes with the messiness of adjusting to a new class -- clear evidence of faculty learning on the spot -- is an overwhelmingly negative description. The messiness is not seen as an opportunity; it is simply “in the way” because it’s not seen to contribute usefully to learning “for the students.”

I think it's been pretty messy so far. You know, I think people are making assignments that students aren't clear on, and that... just some of the technology used to submit stuff and to grade stuff, faculty have had difficulty getting to it... we're getting to a point where we're working through that. I think [the messiness has] been in the way pretty much.  That's my personal opinion. (Gary 2, 47-53)

Iterations on the course design process are also swept under the rug. In describing his interactions with a group of visiting faculty asking for a process on course design, Jon describes his initial response as veering towards polished performance. He creates a printed list of steps for “detailed course design” and hands them to the visitors as a process they can use, even as he admits that he himself did not use the process in designing his courses. Even if Jon “jumped into it” and iterated through his course designs many times, he still presents it as a structured process for outside observers, effectively hiding his iterations and his mess as being “in the way.”

[A group of visiting faculty] wanted to see a process for detailed course design... I stepped them through a process I used to create a course a couple of years ago... and I printed this whole thing, and then at the end had to say, "But honestly we created a lot of courses without any of this structure, without any of these tools. We just kinda had an inkling of what could be, and jumped into it..." (Jon 2, 66)

The "for the students" narratives also rejects narratives where students take other roles. We discussed earlier that the "for the students" narrative does not exclude students from participating in curricular design. However, as we also saw, student participation within this narrative is defined by faculty. Pushing against this narrative with alternate roles for students can lead to tension. Faculty expect to be the gatekeepers of who is and isn't allowed to participate in the curricular revision process.

We typically use alumni, because the students haven't been that involved... and this is not a criticism in any way, but I mean, they come with a very limited viewpoint, because they haven't been out there yet... they're not ready for that conversation yet. (Mark 2, 299)

Mark's comment suggests that students aren't mature enough to help -- not through any fault or deficiency of their own, but by virtue of not having had work experience yet. They are "not ready for that conversation," which is implied to be one owned and run by faculty, with some alumni participation. The alumni themselves have a role prescribed by faculty, as implied by the sentence construction; "we," the faculty, "use alumni."

Another example from Mark gives us some background as to why he might make that statement about student readiness. In the past, he has heard student input on curriculum that has been, in his opinion, less than productive. Unaware of the larger picture of the curricular design and student needs, a student had proposed that welding be added as a universal course requirement.

I've heard students in the past tell us -- you should have a class in just welding... [as] part of the requirements! That's a one-sided, biased consideration... I'm not going to gut my curriculum so I can meet what one student or two students want. I'll help them, guide them, tell them where they can get it, even drive you to the test center. But you've got to understand -- how much flexibility do we actually have when we're trying to serve this population? (Mark 2, 302)

Note Mark's phrasing; he does not want to do something detrimental to "his curriculum," because "we're [the faculty] trying to serve this population." Unfiltered student input, he fears, will be "one-sided" and "biased" and not contribute to the service of the broader student population as a whole. Despite his frustration, Mark's response of doing things that are beneficial "for the students" continues to extend to the student he is critiquing; he offers to "help them" and "guide them" towards their individual learning goals of welding, even as he rejects it as an addition to a curriculum he feels ownership towards.

This exclusion of other stories and perspectives is what makes the “for the students” narrative into a metanarrative. However, like all texts, metanarratives contain contradictions. By using the postmodern techniques from the prior chapter, we can make these alternate narratives visible, and shift our language away from the strict categories and role assignments of faculty-designer, curriculum-object, and student-user. In the sections that follow, we will examine some of the narratives rejected by the metanarrative, and what they might help us make visible about faculty as learners.
