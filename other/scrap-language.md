We can examine the word “design” as a sign that our narrators used frequently in their interviews. As a sign, “design” consists of a signifier — in this case, a six-letter English word that starts with ‘d’ — and a signified which the word refers to (Saussure, 1986). In computer science terms, the signifier and signified can be loosely thought of as the pointer and the memory location.

Just as a pointer can be renamed and reallocated in a computer program, the link between signifier and signified is arbitrary, socially constructed, and forever shifting — two faculty members may use the signifier “design” to refer to very different signifieds (loosely, “ideas.”) Even a single faculty member may use the word “design” in more than one sense in the same sentence: “I design my design courses so that students experience design as freedom and creativity, but it’s also important that they be able to design things that meet functional specifications.” (REPLACE WITH EXAMPLE FROM DATA)

It may be tempting to diagnose this as a problem of insufficiently precise language; if we had more words for “design,” we would not need to repeat it to signify slightly different meanings. However, the repetition of the word “design” is entwined with its representation; a sign obtains meaning only when it’s used in multiple contexts, since community adoption is what distinguishes a “nonsense” word from a “real” one. Because of this, when we speak, write, or use any other sign system such as language, we represent — re-present — our signifieds with signifiers that already exist, and the way we choose to do so can be illuminating to examine (Cavallaro, 2001, p. 39).
