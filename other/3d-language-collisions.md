Language collisions are evidence of, and opportunity for, faculty as learners.

This points out the fluidity of the curriculum (world).

Language collisions happen because different selves in dialogue have different perspectives.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Different selves might mean different selves in time, different individuals, or different groups.

Of course they're different perspectives; varied backgrounds and goals mean the same word carries different connotations.

Since language is a hermeneutical process, we can't magically diff and patch our language to be identical; we're always making sense of what we think is the meaning of the other.

We can respond to differences in language prescriptively in an attempt to enforce alignment.

We can respond to differences in language descriptively in an attempt to clarify in hindsight.

DATA: Olin's realization of "design" being central in hindsight

Different perspectives are an opportunity to expand and modify one's repertoire of perspectives.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We choose how to frame the value of these language differences and the effort spent on their articulation and resolution.
--------------------------------------

Is this signal, or is this noise? Is it valued work, or inconvenience better avoided if possible?

Do we expect ourselves to immediately be able to articulate our learning, and the differences between our learning and the learning of others?

Language differences are indicators and probes what opportunities we may have to learn from each other.

Data

One anecdote by Alan made it clear that needs and values of students were being carefully considered. The TAD faculty had been using some design terminology interchangeably, switching phrases like “design criteria” and “design constraint” around to mean different things in different situations. Due to their comfort in the field of design, the faculty members could understand each other from context. “ I think all of us [faculty] knew, like, if Mark said design criteria or design constraint, I knew what he was talking about,” Alan explained. “But it's confusing to students who are just learning about design... to use both terms interchangeably. So we decided to... have a common language, and the students are using that common language... for the benefit of the students.” (Alan 3, 103, 108) Even if faculty needs regarding terminology were adequately met, the faculty perceived student needs as not being met. In accordance with UCD philosophy, they adjusted to meet the needs of their users.
