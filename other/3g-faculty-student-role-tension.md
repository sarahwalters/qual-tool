There is a tension regarding the distinction between faculty as learners and students as learners, and how those people author the curriculum.

This interrogates the boundary between faculty "self" and student "other."

The curriculum is for, by, and of students.
---------------------------------------------------

If faculty inherit students as part of their curriculum, students are also part of the curriculum. Curriculum is by, for, and of the students.

We already know that "for the students" is part of the metanarrative.

It is also by and of students; they bring in their own interests, hopes, dreams, and learning from prior experiences.

DATA: UOCD language coming to matsci

DATA: Students bringing research projects to capstone class

Other examples include independent studies, clubs with invited faculty advisors, doctoral dissertations, and any other project where the student determines the curriculum and the faculty member follows the student's lead and acts as a coach.

Another example is the experience of teaching different sections of the "same" class.

But we already know and acknowledge a lot of this, perhaps not exactly in this context

Sometimes we can't do things for students. Sometimes students need to do things for themselves.
M2.txt:175:MARK 2: So though I feel for the student, one of the things that I think we've talked about is the fact that, in reality, no matter what name we choose, and I don't know if there's any way to really convey what our students can do, except for our students being able to convey it themselves. (175)

197:MARK 2: That's when it falls down to the students. I don't know if that's fair or unfair. That's something we've all had to do at some point. When you graduate, you leave with a set of skills, and ability -- but one of those key abilities is to be able to communicate. To be able to communicate what you can do. What you can bring a company. What you can do for that future boss. (197)

Applying the transitive property means faculty blur with students

We already see student agency as a good thing.
--------------------------------------------------

We already value student agency and autonomy.

In academia, there is at least some acknowledgement that students play a large role in creating the learning environments they occasionally share with faculty. College brochures speak of student-run clubs and organizations, course tutoring, and other places where undergraduates serve as peer mentors to one another. Outside the classroom, students have agency and autonomy to shape their own environments; they run fraternities and sororities, throw campus events, and serve on student government.

The faculty narrators also talked about valuing student agency and autonomy inside their classrooms. When they spoke of how they aspire to teach their students, those aspirations did not portray students as passive recipients of information.

Gary on critical thinking – it was his doctoral research and is what he aspires to in his teaching, to get his students to become critical thinkers

Alan describing Mark’s approach of letting them struggle; Mark believes that struggling leads students to deeper learning, instead of having things handed to them all the time.

Butttt... there's a line we struggle to cross. Applying the transitive property means faculty blur with students 
------------------------------------------------------------------

If we let faculty be users, we can also let students be designers. blur the boundaries, everyone is a learner and everyone is a teacher, right? lifelong learning!

All quotes marked “freaky friday”
Rob’s analogy of the baton race
Rob handing agency back and forth to Mel in the interview (now I get the baton, and i can hand it back)
And we could push even further
Gary’s service learning trip to the honduras…. we could see this as nested designer/user pairs, or we can really blend them

If faculty are the curriculum they teach and learn from, and students are the curriculum they teach and learn from, then we're left with questions about the distinction between faculty and students. Do they teach and learn from the curriculum in different ways? Do they embody the curriculum in different ways? Do they blur the boundaries between themselves and the curriculum in different ways? Do they construct and get constructed by the curriculum in different ways?

These questions trouble our conceptions of ourselves as faculty. What does it mean to be a faculty member, and what does this mean for how we relate to students?

R4.txt:93:ROB 4: However, I've given workshops where I get this pushback, where people are saying... Some instructors feel they're almost a performer on the stage where they're delivering something, they're delivering this image of authority to the students because that's important for the students to believe in this authority, and the students might need it at certain stages of their education. (93)

This tension shows up in discussions on the role of students in curricular design.

DATA: Mark's comment on student contributions

DATA: Lynn's response

DATA: Jon's response

DATA: Rob's response

All these responses exhibit that tension; students can somehow contribute, but somehow it's also different from what faculty can contribute. The clarity of those "somehows" is variant and slipping.

Ex: How do we listen to student input? Lynn's alternative take responding to Mark.
257:LYNN 4: Mark:  And also if we're going to listen to the students, which I think we should, and I welcome their input, it's also taking it for what it is and where it comes from. (257)
301:MARK 2: Oh yeah, it definitely would be. But it also has to -- I think it requires a certain amount of student interest too. So it's about balancing the two. And also if we're going to listen to the students, which I think we should, and I welcome their input, it's also taking it for what it is and where it comes from. (301)

And now after the shift
how do you teach students to become partners?

what can students do that faculty cannot? they can be young, users
Rob: the benefits of stepping back (another great "learning in the moment" example) and the sorts of things that students can do in course creation that faculty cannot, precisely because of their inexperience and zeal. (??)

students need training to become autonomous
Jon: autonomy is such an important thing. Jon and Mel in matsci class

Did you notice that this makes a separation between students -- who can only be users and not designers of the course -- and faculty, who can only be designers and not users?

Mark’s language about “who’s the we?” “well, it’s the faculty of course. the students can’t possibly help.”
Mark on welding: a student walked up and said “everyone should learn how to weld, and the dept name ought to change” and Mark basically said “you don’t know how to design curriculum and a dept name, we have our reasons”
MARK 2: I've heard students in the past tell us -- you should have a class in just welding. I'm like... That would be great. I mean, yeah, that's fine. We can do that as an exploratory course. She's like... No, part of the requirements! That's a one-sided, biased consideration. Because you want to weld. Yeah, and I want to be certified in it. Then you should go to a trade school. That's not part of our mission. Yeah, I'll teach you how to weld. That's not a problem. If you ask me, I'll teach you. But I'm not going to gut my curriculum so I can meet what one student or two students want. I'll help them, guide them, tell them where they can get it, even drive you to the test center. But you've got to understand -- how much flexibility do we actually have when we're trying to serve this population? We have to be committed to that. (302)

My incredibly biased snap response to that
Olin reactions to pushing that boundary
Lynn: sure they’re naive, but what can you learn from naive student comments? and how do you teach them to be less naive, more helpful?

When we allow ourselves to shift, blur, add, and remove Bohrian cuts around these assemblages, we open up different possibilities for teaching and learning for everyone.

DATA: Rob on feedback

This story is entirely different framed in the metanarrative of "for the students." Rob's example shows him shifting his feedback activities from something very much within that metanarrative -- to something that is now outside of it.

we already think of students as complex learners where agency matters, maybe just not in this arena
we already do this right in many ways
we have freaky friday moments where we can do this but in different contexts, simply transfer them. sometiems we have already started
we already have places where we deliberately try to blur the boundaries between the server and the served, the user and the designer, so it's not just straight up give/recieve role binaries

What it would look like if we looked at faculty as learners more generally?
separating faculty as designers and students as users misses out on growth opportunities for both

Getting students involved in the design process of courses is a way to teach them the design process in general.
LYNN 4: That is, they are actually asking themselves problem framing questions (what do our students need?), but they may not realize that such questions are design questions. (187)
LYNN 4: and so, when they say "our students need to be good designers", I'm not sure whe
ther they are asking "do they need to frame questions as well as answer them?" (190)
