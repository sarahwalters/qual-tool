Faculty, as learners, are assemblages.

They shift self/other within and against other assemblages

DATA: Mark and Alan on Makers

As previously mentioned, when faculty values and needs conflict, it can cause the faculty to disagree on how the curriculum should be designed. For instance, Alan and Mark both spoke of their different perspectives on the Maker Movement, which had led to an in-person disagreement on its place in the curriculum. Alan spoke to his own strong attraction to the Maker Movement, spending a significant portion of our second interview describing the sort of class he might design around the phenomenon. He portrayed the simplicity as positive: “It's just more accessible... You draw it and send it to the printer.” In contrast, Mark spoke negatively of the same simplicity. “All you do is press a button and it works... we are losing the education side.”

ALAN 2: I think that all of us embrace... most of the concepts of [the] Makers Movement. (127)

MARK 1: We had a meeting just last week. Myself and another colleague just laid it out -- I wouldn't say argued -- that person said something, I disagreed and he disagreed, and at the end we realized we agreed. (124)

ALAN 1: Mm-hmm. None of us agree with everything about makers... (268)

MARK 1: It is a good movement, but there is a lot of talk if we should embrace it as a higher education institution. (142) I was against it because I think there are some valuable things to it... But I don't think it is robust enough to replace curriculum by any means. That's my personal opinion. (143) And my colleague disagreed. (144)

ALAN 1: It used to be students didn't have computers. Now everybody has a laptop. Some time down the road somebody will have a 3D printer on the desk if you're a TAD major. (171) it's just more accessible. It's automatic. You draw it and send it to the printer. (172)

MARK 1: He also said the makers movement was very good for our institution because of the complexity of the machines. (147) I viscerally disagreed. (148) All do you is press a button and it works. (150)

ALAN 2: A lot of the things that they're making in the Makers Movement are not really high-tech, complex objects. There's still a whole lot of little plastic trinket parts being made, and that's okay. (142)

MARK 1: We have students that know how to use this equipment but they don't know why they are using it, how it works. (161) We are losing the education side. (164)

ALAN 2: Yeah. I would say right now the Makers Movement is probably heavy on the fabrication, and probably lighter on the design. (166)

MARK 1: We eventually got to that point. (165) "Oh, I agree with you, because I believe it is a more complex machine." (166) "You agree with me, it can be overly simplified." (167) Once we got past that, "Oh, okay, we agree." (171)


Within a "sovereign" individual are many temporal selves whose learning interacts
