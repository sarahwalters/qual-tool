Faculty are learners, too
----------------------------

We often think of engineering and technology faculty as teachers. As facilitators of student learning, they hold philosophies about teaching, learning, and the nature of student/faculty roles. These philosophies shape their interactions in the classroom. However, faculty are also learners themselves. Among other things, they are students of the practice of teaching and curriculum development for engineering and technology.

As engineering education researchers concerned with research-to-practice transfer, the ways we think about faculty-as-learners likewise shape the ways we try to impact their practice. To paraphrase Fincher and Tenenberg (2007), changes in engineering education must require change in the specific practices of engineering educators; therefore, if engineering education researchers are to impact student learning, we must investigate the practices of engineering educators. Specifically, making faculty visible as learners in different ways can help us recognize and reward faculty engaging in learning experiences that fall outside current evaluation processes.

During the course of this project, I have employed postmodern and poststructural lens to challenge our perspectives on faculty-as-learners. Postmodernism and poststructuralism ("post\*") are paradigms that constantly seek a "making-strange" and unsettling of habitual narratives. A post* view challenges us to remain in the discomfort of liminal (in-between) spaces where everything is constantly troubled and nothing ever really settles. This study demonstrates a concrete method for engaging faculty members in that liminal space. Through it, I contribute to our ability to articulate and value faculty explorations in chaotic territories such as large-scale curriculum redesigns, new program formation, and other places where valuable growth occurs but is rarely put into words.

How can we think of faculty as learners?
------------------------------------------

In this section, I will briefly describe several qualities of faculty-as-learners, compare and contrast them to the qualities presented in existing literature, and explore why it may be valuable to make these qualities visible. Note that by comparing and contrasting my approach to other studies, I am not making statements about the relative quality or validity of their work. I am also not saying that these ways of viewing faculty-as-learners are not present in any existing literature. I am simply using differences and similarities to more clearly articulate certain assumptions about faculty-as-learners that are present in this project.

### Faculty learn by engaging in liminal experiences

The first quality of faculty-as-learners is that they often learn by engaging in liminal experiences. Liminal experiences are characterized by activities that do not fall into a cleanly articulable structure, and can therefore be described as poststructural. In fact, the liminal experiences of faculty are often explicitly about dismantling old structures and remaking new ones, such as the founding of a new college (S. Kerns, Miller, & D. Kerns, 2005) or degree program (Katehi et. al., 2004), dramatic overhauls of an existing curriculum (Mentkowski, 2000), or the creation of experimental classes.

The trouble with liminal experiences is that they stand outside the realm of structure, including the structure of validation and reward. Our existing academic system rewards faculty for engaging in liminal spaces for their research, so long as they are able to publish papers about it afterwards. However, the examples listed all impact teaching, a form of scholarship that is underdeveloped and unrecognized (Shulman, 1998), with a correspondingly slow speed of change. New faculty are explicitly taught strategies to minimize the time spent on teaching by bounding its uncertainty and tightly controlling their engagment in liminal teaching spaces (LIST NEW FACULTY BOOKS HERE).

This incentive structure for avoiding curricular experimentation stands in tension alongside a long-time call for innovation in engineering education. Mann’s (1918) calls for engineering educators to improve student retention, make undergraduate workloads reasonable, and increase hands-on training still sound as relevant today as when he wrote his report nearly a century ago. Our calls for transforming engineering education (National Academy of Engineering, 2005; Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences, & National Academy of Engineering, 2007; McKenna, 2011) will similarly go unheeded unless we find ways to understand and articulate the ways faculty learn and work in these liminal spaces.

### Faculty use narration to make sense of their learning

The second quality of faculty-as-learners is that they are narrators. Humans use narrative as a way to make sense of their world (Bruner, NARRATIVE CONSTRUCTION OF REALITY). Narratives help us build cognitive schema (CITE: DEF'N OF COGNITIVE SCHEMA) by organizing concepts and the relationships between them. They are a tool for reflection, which is an important part of the learning process (Schön, 1983).

Faculty members are adult learners, with rich histories of experience to draw upon, as well as expectations of agency (Vella, 1997). As narrators, they are highly capable and interdependent agents who both read and co-author the stories of “how things are done” within their culture. They expect a high degree of autonomy in their work (CITE: FACULTY DEV LIT - QUALITIES OF FACULTY JOBS). Within this autonomy, faculty constantly write and rewrite the narratives of their professional lives. For example, these narratives may take the form of research and teaching statements in job applications (CITE: NEW FACULTY HANDBOOKS) or "grant narratives" (CITE: GRANTWRITING BOOKS) 

The Disciplinary Commons initiative (Tenenberg & Fincher, 2007), which scaffolds faculty through a dialogic process of creating teaching portfolios for their existing courses, is an exemplar of validating faculty as adult learners. Initiatives that treat faculty as mere empty “buckets” to be filled with “information about teaching,” such as information sessions dedicated to lecturing faculty about why they should not lecture, may have a limited impact because of this epistemological disjoint -- "that's not how we think" -- as well as an ontological disjoint -- "...because people like us don't operate this way."

### Faculty are situated learners

The third quality of faculty-as-learners is that they are situated in a rich context of practice. Faculty are members of multiple communities of practice (Wenger, 1999), and one of those communities of practice (CoP) is that of of teaching their discipline. This is the organizational scheme used by Fincher and Tenenberg in their "Disciplinary Commons," who built groups of faculty from different institutions who taught roughly the same course; for instance, a group of faculty who taught "Introductory Programming" at different area colleges. (Fincher & Tenenber, 2007, WARREN'S QUESTION). 

As members situated in a community of practice, faculty learn by making sense of the activities of other practitioners around them. They engage in cognitive apprenticeships, a form of learning that involves making one's thinking visible in the context of real engagement in a practice (Collins, Brown, & Newman, 1987; Collins, Brown, & Holum, 1991). Through making their thinking visible to themselves and others, and observing the thinking and practice of others, faculty develop the skill of reflection-in-action (Schön, 1983) by  By engaging in reflection-in-action, they develop their skills of metacognition and self-monitoring, which they then use to improve their own practice. Existing engineering education change initiatives have used this cognitive apprenticeship approach to build Faculty Learning Communities (Cox, 2004; CITE: PULFORD, 2014) and other communities of practice to encourage rigorous research in engineering education (Streveler, Smith, & Miller, 2005).

Understanding faculty as situated and communal learners helps explain the limited success of an “information dissemination” approach (Siddiqui and Adams, 2013) to research-to-practice transfer. If faculty change their teaching practice primarily in response to direct interactions with colleagues (Fincher, Richards, Finlay, Sharp, & Falconer, 2012) and not print materials, it’s no surprise that journal papers continue to go unread (Borrego, Froyd, & Hall, 2010).

Research question
-----------------------

By diving alongside engineering and technology faculty with/in their stories of liminal experiences in curricular development, I address the following research question: How can the interacting narratives of engineering and technology faculty inform our understanding of faculty as learners?
