Since this project is a poststructural/postmodern one, we need to think about its validity as scholarly work from a poststructural/postmodern perspective. First, we will look at what constitutes scholarship, according to Glassick et al's "Scholarship Assessed." Then we will look at validity criteria, largely drawing from Patti Lather’s various works but also from several contemporary postmodern/poststructural scholarly works and how they have positioned their own validity.

Validity

This subsection summarizes the study’s approach to validity from a poststructural perspective. It describes several facets of poststructural validity adopted from Patti Lather’s various works and explains how this particular study addresses each facet.

### Triangulation: drawing from multiple sources

Lather’s 1986 paper, “Issues of validity in openly ideological research: Between a rock and a soft place,” lays out 4 guidelines (p. 67) that appear repeatedly in her later work. The first guideline is triangulation, which in this setting means drawing from “multiple data sources, methods, and theoretical schemes.”

#### Multiple data sources

6 narrators, all interviewed multiple times, plus things that "don't count" as data but informed it: campus visits, experience as part of that scholarly community, informal conversations, member checks, etc. (This section will question and blur boundaries around what counts as "data" for a project.)

#### Multiple methods

Listing the analytical techniques I used in going through the data, largely in hindsight. (There are multiple, but this is the weaker section of validity for this project.)

#### Multiple theoretical schemes

See lit review, basically -- list theoretical schemes from that, plus note that narrators provided their own theoretical schemes in some cases (great examples: Rob and Gary.)

### Construct validity: narrator reflexivity

The second guideline is construct validity, a systemized reflexivity regarding the theories we operate within, our preconceptions about them, and how we critique and transform them in response to our actual data. This section will explain how my assumptions were transformed -- and evidence that I myself was transformed -- by this work.

### Face validity

Face validity is granted when study participants consider the study’s analysis to be valid.

* Grounded indigenous coding directly involves faculty narrators, the “study participants,” as major analysts within the project; analysts are likely to produce analyses they affirm as valid. 
* Since faculty narrators are both “study participants” and “analysts,” they must also develop systemized reflexivity, a situation that intertwines construct and face validity for this study. (expand)
* Conversations after the final interview concluded -- continuing to see this work and our engagements as useful to them?

### Catalyic validity: transforming reality

The fourth and final guideline is catalytic validity, or the extent to which the project “reorients, focuses, and energizes participants toward knowing reality in order to transform it” (p. 67). 

* Jon and Lynn's tussle with each other and their mutual understanding of Lynn's sarcasm and Jon's predisposition towards mess
* Mark's "thick skin" moment
* Rob going "oh, wait, that's how design happened?"
* Alan and Gary don't exhibit this, I think. But that is not a problem. Not everyone takes up on this, not everyone who takes up on this does it in ways I see and recognize, not everyone who takes up on this learns it RIGHT NOW (the "faculty learn from things from their past... at all times!" phenomenon -- you're never "done" learning from an incident)
