Faculty learn as downstream recipients of curricula and students from their colleagues.

This blurs the distinction between world and other.

Faculty learning is for, by, and of colleagues.
------------------------------------------------------
From a different perspective, colleagues are also faculty "selves"; we've covered this in a prior section. (Re-spin examples from that section to the outside perspective. Some examples below:)

DATA: Gary learning how to work with other TAD faculty

DATA: Deliberately pairing Daniel to team-teach


Faculty can inherit curricula or a gap in it.
------------------------------------------------------

DATA: Dan Frey leaving

DATA: Paul leaving

DATA: Gary passing 130 to a future faculty member

DATA: TAD courses passing amongst faculty

DATA: Olin faculty and visitors rotating through UOCD

Faculty can inherit students.
------------------------------------------------------

DATA: TAD research students coming from 130

DATA: Stuff of History students coming from UOCD

DATA: Rob's baton analogy

The curriculum faculty learn with and within is complex.
