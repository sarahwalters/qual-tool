# qual-tool
A qualitative analysis tool initially designed to facilitate the understanding of faculty as learners -- by reading the stories they tell about teaching. (Poststructurally!)

Intended to support [Mel Chua's PhD dissertation in engineering education](https://github.com/mchua/facultyaslearners) (Purdue University).
