Bring Rob and Lynn’s comments on Mark’s question to Jon.

Bring Rob’s description of frameworks and Jon (and Mark Somerville) to Jon.

Rob’s comments on course design (re: if you don’t like this, step back, why was this in the course design) paralell Gary’s “habit of mind…” comments. “when I walk into a room like this, I notice what the walls are made of, and what the ceiling is made of, and what the furniture is made of, and if it’s a good design it probably has a reason… and you immediately look through that and you think, “I could improve this by doing that or improve this or change this around.” I think there’s a habit of mind we would like to move toward.”
