Rob's q for berea: how are students reacting to this? are these insights happening in the classroom or in the planning meeting? what's the vibe in the classroom?

tradeoff between instructor learning and student price paid?

2nd q for Berea: Gary's quote of understanding the student population and where they're coming from, their baggage; Olin may not be as good at doing that. How do you do that? What have you found - are there any personas?

some sections use Rob's "History of Technology" frameworks.

"co-teaching" section uses technological systems framework - bringing ideas into the real world

"aligning faculty" section uses paradigm shift framework

re paradigm shift, maybe bring in Alan and Gary's "how did you come to teach this way, if you're a similar generation as the faculty you described as resistant?" responses

For transcribers:
* Technological systems framework (inventor, entrepreneur, hyphenation of inventor-entrepreneur)
* Thomas Kuhn - paradigm shift theory

next time: 
* start with student involvement
* want to hear jon and lynn reactions to berea stuff (mark's question, gary's section on understanding students and how they understand them to be and the process by which they do that)
* more berea stuff if we need it
