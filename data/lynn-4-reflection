In lines 275-295, Lynn tells a story about an Honor Board case, which is the student discipline system at Olin. Although she was already careful in the telling of her story, we agreed that we should check with the current (student) leaders of the Honor Board before publicizing the data, since this was potentially identifiable and linkable to a specific case abstract (Honor Board case abstracts are private).

I emailed the Honor Board, and William Warner and Victoria Preston responded. After a bit of back and forth, and some light edits to the transcript, they agreed that using the lightly edited transcript would be fine.
